Birthdate palindrome
Palindrome means same number from both side
In this project I have used bootstrap to make it responsive
This projects takes the birthdate from the ueser and campare it with 6 date formates [ddmmyyyy,  mmddyyyy, yyyymmdd, ddmmyy, mmddyy, yymmdd]
and tells user it his birthdate is Palindrome or not.
as well as tells user the last and future palindrome date
it tells user by how many date user missed the palindrome birthdate
